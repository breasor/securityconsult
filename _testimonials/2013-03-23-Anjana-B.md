I was in a tough situation both financially and with the alarm system. It turned out to be on issue after another with the my existing system and given my situation/constraints - Julius worked with me stayed late and added extra to getting it working and kept the cost the same. He wanted me to have a working system before he left and he ensured that. Added to that that he was responsive to phone calls and e-mails - I would highly recommend him and his company
