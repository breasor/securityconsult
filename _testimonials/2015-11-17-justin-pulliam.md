These guys are the best! I have medical offices all over the country and Security Consultants came to the rescue when I had already
called 3 other companies and no one would come out to install the camera system I had already purchased. His team not only came out after business hours but finished the job faster than any other
office I had done. They were clean and friendly and the price was fair for the job done. While in my office they noted I had some existing alarm devices and offered to update and take over the system
as well and the monthly monitoring fee was better than I pay elsewhere. I could not recommend the team at Security Consultants enough.
