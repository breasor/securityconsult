I'm a small business owner with a time and financial budget. My kennel was experiencing outside theft, vandalism and a loitering problem. The owner and his employees were professional, on time and very good with questions and helping me to understand my best options. I would re-hire in a heartbeat. They brought in an electrician who was also excellent - these guys are the best contractors I have dealt with in 7 years. Thank you!
