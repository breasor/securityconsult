When they mounted my TV I didn't want the cable box/modem/dvd on the furniture and insisted against advice that it be put on the floor. After the installer left I decided I hated it. I called back and they cheerfully returned and corrected everything to my satisfaction without charging me another cent. They were neat and cleaned up any mess made. wore covers on shoes and totally did a great job for a reasonable price. I highly recommend this company and would use them again without a doubt
