  - project: Install, Service, or Repair Surveillance Cameras
    comments: >
      Julius is an outstanding and professional service provider.
      He & his team installed an outdoor security system over a large area.
      He made sure that all of our needs were met at all phases: sale, installation,
      and even after the system was installed. We have worked with several contractors and
      many of them have lacked customer service skills, professionalism, and common courtesy.
      Julius and his team had to dig trenches and bring along tools/equipment, but they were
      careful not to damage our property and did not leave debris behind.
      Security Consult is a great business to work with!

      ADT installed my home alarm system, but refused to come out when it malfunctioned.
      Julian was very professional and fixed my problem within minutes.
      I would call them again if alarm has any more problems and would recommend them to others.
