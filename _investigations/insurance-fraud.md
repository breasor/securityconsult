According to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, an estimated $80 billion is paid out annually in fraudulent insurance claims. This affects every American, as these false insurance claims cost the average household more than $950 each year in higher premiums. Plus, false insurance claims can mean that you are held liable in a staged accident and increase your risk of being sued. The high instance of insurance fraud has meant that insurance companies are far more cautious when paying claims, which may mean that you need professional help to make your claim.

While not an exhaustive list, here are the most common types of Insurance Fraud:

* Auto Insurance Fraud
* Underwriting Fraud
* Staged Accidents
* Health Insurance
* Medicare Fraud
* Medicaid Fraud
* Medical Identity Theft
* Slip & Fall Injuries
* Personal Injury Fraud
* Property-casualty Fraud
* Workers Compensation


Regardless of the type of insurance fraud you have encountered, you will need an experienced private investigator to help you sort out the facts.
