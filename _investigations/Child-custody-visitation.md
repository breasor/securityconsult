  <p>There are few things more devastating than a house fire, as it can mean the loss of priceless possessions. Thatâ€™s why Security Consult, Inc designs and installs custom fire alarm systems for all types of residential applications.
  </p>


  <p>Our fire alarm systems go beyond just smoke or fire detection; they can include the additional detection of carbon monoxide (CO) and other gases, extreme high and/or low temperatures, and the monitoring of sprinkler and other fire suppression systems. We can also help you re-activate a non-functioning system, and bring it up to date with North Carolina fire code.</p>

  <p>Please note, your fire alarm must be connected to our monitoring center so that the fire department can immediately be made aware of a house fire if it occurs. If you would like to discuss our residential fire alarm systems and fire alarm monitoring service, contact Security Consult, Inc today.</p>
