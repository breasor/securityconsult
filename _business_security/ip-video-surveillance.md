Security Consult, Inc can prepare a customized, Internet protocol (IP) video security solution for your business. Your new camera system can record activity on your property when it happens, so that you can view the footage via a secure Internet connection and use it as critical evidence when necessary. Of course, your cameras can also act as deterrence to theft and other unwanted behaviors, so that potential criminals may not act in the first place.

Many times, we are asked to provide businesses with a hybrid video surveillance solution. For example, you may wish for us to convert your existing analog camera system to an IP solution, so that your older cameras can be compatible with Internet video viewing.

Security Consult, Inc has installed over 100 video surveillance systems for large commercial facilities, and numerous security camera systems for small to mid-sized businesses. For more information, contact Security Consult, Inc to request a video surveillance consultation for your business.
