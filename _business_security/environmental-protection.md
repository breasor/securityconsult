Security Consult, Inc has the environmental protection solutions you need to safeguard your business from the risks of fire, flooding and carbon monoxide. When you implement these into your security system, you can receive text or email alerts whenever dangerous environmental conditions are present on your commercial property. In the event of fire or carbon monoxide, our monitoring center will also be alerted so that help will be on its way.

We can also incorporate temperature sensors so that when the temperature rises above or falls below the threshold you program your system for, you will receive a notification and can tend to the matter immediately. This is especially important for businesses that require specific temperature ranges to protect inventory, such as food service establishments.

If you are interested in any of these environmental protection options for your business, contact Security Consult, Inc today. We will be glad to answer your questions
