There are few things more devastating than a fire. To a business, it can mean a loss of income. And in your home, it can mean the loss of priceless possessions. That's why Security Consult, Inc designs and installs custom fire alarm systems for all types of applications.

Our systems go beyond just smoke or fire detectionâ€”they can include detection of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and other gases, extreme high and/or low temperatures, and the monitoring of sprinkler and other fire suppression systems. We can also help you re-activate a non-functioning system, all in compliance with your local and state fire codes. Learn more about our Fire Alarm Inspection Service.
