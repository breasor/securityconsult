Security Consult, Inc carries low voltage, addressable smoke detectors that are ideal for all types of homes. Chances are, your home already has 110 smoke alarms installed. That’s good, but remember: 110 smoke alarms don’t summon the fire department.

Unless your smoke alarms are addressable (able to be connected to our central station), they will not trigger the fire department in the event of a fire – and no, your existing smoke alarms cannot be made addressable. Ask Security Consult, Inc about a addressable smoke detector that will connect to the central station, so you can have the peace of mind you need.

We install all fire alarms to New Jersey state codes, so you can have the appropriate number of smoke alarms in the home. If you would like to speak to us about our residential smoke alarms, contact Security Consult, Inc today. We look forward to helping you.
