# Your security system will only summon help if it is monitored by a UL listed central station.

Security Consult, Inc can implement a wide variety of monitoring resources to accommodate your particular security needs. We typically use a standard telephone line to provide digital communication between your alarm panel and the central station. Communication may also be established through the use of a primary or secondary, or back-up, radio transmitter or other wireless service.

Additionally, we provide other monitoring products including Two-Way Voice, which allows hands-free communication between the alarm dispatcher and your premise; and Internet Monitoring, which enables your security system to communicate with the Central Station via the Internet and a broadband connection.
