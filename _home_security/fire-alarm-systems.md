There are few things more devastating than a house fire, as it can mean the loss of priceless possessions. Thatâ€™s why Security Consult, Inc designs and installs custom fire alarm systems for all types of residential applications.

Our fire alarm systems go beyond just smoke or fire detection; they can include the additional detection of carbon monoxide (CO) and other gases, extreme high and/or low temperatures, and the monitoring of sprinkler and other fire suppression systems. We can also help you re-activate a non-functioning system, and bring it up to date with North Carolina fire code.

Please note, your fire alarm must be connected to our monitoring center so that the fire department can immediately be made aware of a house fire if it occurs. If you would like to discuss our residential fire alarm systems and fire alarm monitoring service, contact Security Consult, Inc today.
